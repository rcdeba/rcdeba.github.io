Using Kollár's formalism of stable pairs, one can construct two different compactifications of M (M<sub>a</sub> and M<sub>b</sub>), corresponding to a and b.

The main result is that, up to replacing M<sub>a</sub> and M<sub>b</sub> with their normalizations, there are birational morphisms M<sub>a</sub> &rarr; M<sub>b</sub>.

The linearized operator of such an instanton, under the model data, yields a self-adjoint first order elliptc operator P on a bundle over S<sup>5</sup>. Using the "Quaternion structure" in the Sasakian geometry of S<sup>5</sup>, we describe the spectrum of P, and give an example.</td>
